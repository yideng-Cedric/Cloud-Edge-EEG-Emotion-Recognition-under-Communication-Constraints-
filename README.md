# Cloud-Edge-EEG-Emotion-Recognition-under-Communication-Constraints-
In this work, we systematically quantify
the impact of network reliability, temporal resolution, and
compression strategies on EEG emotion recognition using
controlled experiments on the SEED-IV dataset with a
CNN–LSTM–Attention model
